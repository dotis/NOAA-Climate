## MBON/NOAA Climate Co-Design Workshop 7/27/2023

### Notes:

See slides from Chris S.

### AIS vessel traffic
1. AIS - Only for larger ships
2. Sound - need to interpret signals
3. Coastal radar - Works well, but 5nm radius
4. Satellite - Maxar product (free?) - Could we use S2?

### Turbidity from vessel traffic
1. Can we look in the Keys using S2?

### Bottom temperatures
1. Modeled products - D. Amaya
2. SST (1-5km) from an array of satellites
3. Bottom mounted sensors (Sofar, OOI)

### Questions from Gray's Reef
1. Visitor traffic
2. Turbidity? - Spin up 1-km OC/SST prods for East Coast (and West Coast)?
   a. Do a test with one year of data - use L2BIN/L3MAPGEN
   b. Kim Roberson/Stan Rogers - email and start a convo
