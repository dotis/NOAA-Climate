## NOAA Climate Indicators Project
## Task Force Meeting Notes

Initial meeting (will meet monthly at this time):

## 1/10/2023 Tuesday 11am ET

Name: Climate Science & Information for Sanctuaries Task Force

Related projects should align. USF will link with other projects in the SE US.

Working Groups will be formed.

We will meet with sanctuary staff at a future meeting and present to the RC's and others.

## Notes from Mtg. on 2/14/2023

Dillon Amaya: Marine heatwaves; need to standardize baselines; poor communication practices within the community. a. Normal is some fixed period in the past (fixed baseline) b. Or, use a shifted baseline where now 1990-2020 (30 year baseline).
Miscommunication occurs depending on which baseline method is used.
Working group is writing a paper to clairfy this issue.

Josh K.- How do we choose a method? Can they be blended?

Use the metric you want, but describe using precise terminology "heat stress" vs. "heatwave"

Three categories: long-term warming, heatwaves (extremes) above a shifted baseline, then look at them together ("total heat exposure", "heat stress" or other "extreme heat"?)

From MTK: Will there be a mechanistic typology associated-- e.g. whether a marine warming is caused by changes in local atmospheric or circulation, in your discussion? This may be more relevant/easy in hindcast.

From Zac C. (via Frank): Zac Cannizzo gave this example of a possible confusing statement: (e.g. "the heat stress (anomaly) resulted in increased heat stress (physiology) in the target organism"). Further, "heat stress" in an organism is often a threshold that can be defined physiologically. This could potentially lead to further confusions of terminology (e.g. "while a heat stress (anomaly) occurred, it did not trigger heat stress (physiology) in the target organism").

Josh K: Do we need to separate this? A more holistic approach? A "heat system". If we take this a single system, can we see other synergies and effects when we combine the long term trends and extreme events.

Craig Risien: Can we just extend the climatology? Would increase in length as time goes on. Dillon: Fixed and shifted are most common, but we could look into the extended. Now that we have more data, why not use it? Next steps: put this in a science paper after the methods paper.

FMK: Can we adopt the set of "normals" that the atmospheric/climate folks use? Can we do this even without lots of data.

Daniel Berrie: This type of group can be more progressive than other more operational folks (NCEI, etc.). We can adopt and propose more forward looking solutions to this than others can/will. Operational folks may not want to re-calculate baselines.

From M. Jacox: @Dan, agree. WMO is good in principal, but the climatology can still be way out of date. e.g., in 2029, a 1991-2020 climatology is missing ~25 years of long-term warming

FMK: What is next? How can these two TFs work together? Also, what is next for our group.

Dillon: Nature paper is in review, may need signatories for a letter to the community.

M. Fewings: Nature paper wording not "set in stone", but well underway. Most likely, "heat stress" will not be used. Also would welcome co-authors on a follow-up science focused paper.

Jenny Waddell: +1 for "total heat exposure" as the metric, and then we can use extreme heat in discussion.

Andrew Leising: A lot of this heat exposure will be variable impacts to organisms depending on their lifespan, critical life stages, etc. and the timing of when the heat hits them.

JW: @Andy and also need to build in duration of extreme events. that's why I like total heat exposure...it implies that there are multiple factors at play

MF: Can we extend climatologies when data is short, gapped or sparse? Can the two groups collaborate on this?

AL: two 5 day heatwaves separated by two weeks is different than one 10 day heatwave, depending on the organism, but depending on how you calculate your index, those might give you same value.

CR: Methods matter: When calculating climatologies, don't always use a mean. How to deal with gappy data? How do we get to the best climatology? What do you do where there are no data or sensor failures, etc. Harmonically fitted to monthly means? Smoothing?

M. Johnston (FGBNMS): FGBNMS has a lot of long time series used for condition reports. Are we doing it right? Can the sanctuaries benefit from a collaboration with this group?

JW: I am concerned about generating means on a weekly or monthly basis...we also really want to know the min/max on a daily basis, which can get lost
AL: How do we define spatial scales between locations (large vs. small sancturies). How do we define spatial boundaries?

J. Brown: Not every site has the same data. Where we do have consistent data, it would be good to have a group to think about indicators and how they can be defined for different sites. Looking at the NMS system as a whole. A standard set of metrics/indicators across sanctuaries.

MJ: Should different sanctuaries be treating their data in the same way? Can sanctuaries get guidance for this from the group?

MF: Can we develop a toolbox?


## Notes from Task Force meeting on 3/14/2023:

Further discussion on climate vulnerability on the part of sanctuaries.
    
Dan Berrie (NOAA) - Can we meet at a mtg. of opportunity. OSM in Feb 2024 in NO is a good possibility. Find space at a hotel or a room nearby. Or, an ad hoc meeting may work, but be difficult. Could also do a networking meetup over dinner or evening event.
    
FMK - That might work, also may have an MBON meeting around that time.

Ideas for sub-groups: dashboards (Otis, Fewings, Asche, K. Dunning) Jeffrey Runge (indicators), Tammy Silva (forage fish - NMS system wide), Kelly M. (also include climate indicators, indicator work is currently being done with IEA, etc. Zach C. - Also talk about tying indicators to dashboards)
    How to organize and share data? Google Drive,
    Zac C. - Time is ripe for climate indicators and dashboards - report is coming out shortly)
    JR - Calanus indicator (important indicator in the GoME)
    DB - Ecosystem status reports - who can interface? Chris (Caldo?) has more information. Don't want to add too many new indicators (saturated). There is a formal process to add indicators.
    ZC - The scale of indicators is important and dependent on the scale of the information provided.
    Comment from Jen Brown (I wonder if it would make sense to have a few presentations at a subsequent meeting of this group to provide overview info of SanctuaryWatch (Jenn, Kelly), the MBON Dashboards (Dan Otis), NAMes (Will Klajbor) and other examples if available)
    Comment from Mike Jacox: my impression is that site has somewhat limited scope for regional tailoring, no?

Presentations:

### Kathy Broughton (manages assessment program) - condition reports (status and trends) - slides are available here (add LINK) Next generation of condition reports have notable improvements - will now include assessment of ecosystem services

Questions: Josh K. - How can one access the data? Sanctuaries mostly go straight to the PI, some data is synthesized (IEA)

From Jen Brown: @Joshua - that is a great question and one of the thing we are trying to do with the MBON and CPO groups is work on streamlining data access, analysis and display for key indicators that address condition report questions across multiple sanctuaries.

From Jenny Waddell: I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but here is what we tried to do at OCNMS for ocean climate indicators...as an example https://noaa-onms.github.io/ocnms/ocean-climate.html

@jenny its preferable to use the Sanctuary Watch URL (https://sanctuarywatch.ioos.us/webcr-olympiccoast/ocean-climate) instead of the github URL

### ZC - climate vulnerability assessment (CVA) - Forward looking from current conditions. These will inform climate informed management plan. Vulnerability assessments are not always in sync with condition reports. (Slides HERE). These assessments give information to make decisions.

CVA guide: https://nmssanctuaries.blob.core.windows.net/sanctuaries-prod/media/docs/2023-mpa-climate-vulnerability-assessment-guide.pdf

ZC - Worksheets are in the appendicies of the CVA guidance. The appendicies can be found here --> https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/media/docs/2023-mpa-climate-vulnerability-assessment-guide-appendices.pdf

From Ginny Selz - While we are transitioning, I'd like to highlight the Climate Observations and Monitoring program manager position (my old position) is currently open and advertised through UCAR. Please share with your networks and any interested individuals. I've added the links to the Announcements section of the Agenda.

### Sarah Stein - Management Plans: Adaptive management - use outputs from CRs and CVAs to guide management. Every ~5-10 years. Process: Management Plan Review (~3 years to complete). Slides HERE.

From Chris Simoniello: Who is the best person for Jen D and I to contact to request access to the sanctuaries preliminary Climate Assessment report? The information would be tremendously helpful in guiding development of the stakeholder workshop agendas. - Zac C.
